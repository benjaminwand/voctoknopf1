The keycaps are: <https://github.com/benjaminwand/Cherry-MX-keycaps/blob/master/gothic.FCStd>, 20 * 33,5 mm for the composite mode buttons, 25 * 25 mm for the camera/channel buttons and 40 * 40 mm for the take button. Please adjust the side lengths in the spreadsheet of the file.


Lessons learnt after PCB production: wrong footprint for resistors (too short) and cherry switches (contacts for LEDs are too far apart). 4.7k ohm pull-up-resistors are required between A4 and 5V and A5 and 5V.
